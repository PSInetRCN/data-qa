Abbreviation,Type
BSV,"Barren Sparse Vegetation: Lands exposed soil, sand, or rocks and has less than 10% vegetative cover during any time of the year."
CRO,"Croplands: Lands covered with temporary crops followed by harvest and a bare soil period (e.g., single and multiple cropping systems). Note that perennial woody crops will be classified as the appropriate forest or shrub land cover type."
CSH,Closed Shrublands: Lands with woody vegetation less than 2 meters tall and with shrub canopy cover >60%. The shrub foliage can be either evergreen or deciduous.
CVM,"Cropland/Natural Vegetation Mosaics: Lands with a mosaic of croplands, forest, shrublands, and grasslands in which no one component comprises more than 60% of the landscape."
DBF,Deciduous Broadleaf Forests: Lands dominated by woody vegetation with a percent cover >60% and height exceeding 2 meters. Consists of broadleaf tree communities with an annual cycle of leaf-on and leaf-off periods.
DNF,Deciduous Needleleaf Forests: Lands dominated by woody vegetation with a percent cover >60% and height exceeding 2 meters. Consists of seasonal needleleaf tree communities with an annual cycle of leaf-on and leaf-off periods.
EBF,Evergreen Broadleaf Forests: Lands dominated by woody vegetation with a percent cover >60% and height exceeding 2 meters. Almost all trees and shrubs remain green year round. Canopy is never without green foliage.
ENF,Evergreen Needleleaf Forests: Lands dominated by woody vegetation with a percent cover >60% and height exceeding 2 meters. Almost all trees remain green all year. Canopy is never without green foliage.
GRA,"Grasslands: Lands with herbaceous types of cover. Tree and shrub cover is less than 10%. Permanent wetlands lands with a permanent mixture of water and herbaceous or woody vegetation. The vegetation can be present in either salt, brackish, or fresh water."
